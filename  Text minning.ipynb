       " 'When I first read about Amazon Echo Show, I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size, which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras, so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2, so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo\\'s and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7\" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator; Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa, just as with Echo or Dot, & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- Say: Alexa, show me the \"Front Porch\", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet, so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT, but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!!',\n",

       " 'If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather, markets, and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly, the product is top of the line technology, and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it, and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect; it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand, and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen, and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb, with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well, but it only works with android, Samsung, Fire OS, IOS device, excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions, and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App, which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved, is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words, and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices, so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well, for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you.',\n",

The emphasis with this item is \"show\", so it\\'s no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo, but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone, this product delivers. It\\'s value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams. Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show, so that you can do \"drop in\", which is essentially visual phone calls. It\\'s great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy.',\n",

Hands free is the way to go.',\n",
       " 'The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device. I\\'m not sure if I\\'m missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as San Diego Zoo Elephants) that you can\\'t get on the Show. While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. Setup was pretty straight forward and easy. It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as \"play\" or \"start\" or \"open\") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination. You would have to set up several different alarms, one for each day as far as I can see. Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming, I don\\'t really want to be terrified awake each day. I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well. It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you\\'d like. I don\\'t see that yet anywhere. Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off. If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times I\\'d rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe, which is possible, but very sensitive and if you miss, here comes snooze! Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly. I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time. Hoping that works well when it arrives.It will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed. All in all I\\'d say it\\'s a good emerging technology but needs a little work. Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago It\\'s kind of where we\\'re heading.',\n",
       " \"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!\",\n",

Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for.

I spoke to both Amazon and Target about this, and neither could tell me what happened. I was offered an exchange if I wished. I chose to keep the original unit, but I wanted to make others aware of the issue. I have one theory. Target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for Target resale, and they are all registered to this person. I guess I'll never know. The Echo itself works fine and I'm very happy with it.

Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore, and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing.',\n",

       " \"I have had the Echo Show for about a month now. So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. Alexa is great for listening to music, most of it free if you're an Amazon Prime member, pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up, so you don't have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work. If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show, she's your girl, but if you want to know something, you might have to look it up yourself. IE; weather forecast, you get whatever Bing uses and the short version. If Bing would expand their horizons in searches, I would definitely 5 star this item. She does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists. I am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays. All in all, very fun, helpful, item. It can order you pizza too.\",\n",

Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices.

I freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome! You could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever, wherever you have it. Keep in mind you're only gonna see what it's pointed at. The camera doesn't move. Plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward. There are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down. Almost forgot but the speakers are amazing! You can link multiple echos together to play music. I have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a JBL speaker in another room.

Also, honestly, and anyone can prove it just through everyday use, but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries. It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn't understand or can't help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it.

The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!\",\n",

We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in. We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldn't believe it. My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon.Another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is.

Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for.

      "I'm planning on setting another one up at my 93 year old mothers house.\n",
      "She'll get a kick out of it also.\n",
      "Bought 3 of these for Christmas for my Family members.I‚Äôve had mine for a year in my Kitchen and just love it!So much you can do with it and works great with my 5 Arlo Pro cameras.Big plus...Amazon is Always updating the Show to do more.\n",
      "Despite a less than friendly price point (if you don't get it on sale), this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description.\n",
      "The emphasis with this item is \"show\", so it's no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo, but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone, this product delivers.\n",
      "It's value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams.\n",
      "Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show, so that you can do \"drop in\", which is essentially visual phone calls.\n",
      "It's great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy.\n",
      "Previously had 2 echo Dots in play at my home, so knew I wanted more from my Alexa.\n",
      "Echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions.\n",
      "Also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream, too!!!\n",
      "Very cool.\n",
      "Looking forward to Alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics.\n",
      "Hands free is the way to go.\n",
      "The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device.\n",
      "I'm not sure if I'm missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as San Diego Zoo Elephants) that you can't get on the Show.\n",
      "While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch.\n",
      "Setup was pretty straight forward and easy.\n",
      "It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent.\n",
      "It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want.\n",
      "(such as \"play\" or \"start\" or \"open\") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination.\n",
      "You would have to set up several different alarms, one for each day as far as I can see.\n",
      "Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming, I don't really want to be terrified awake each day.\n",
      "I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well.\n",
      "It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you'd like.\n",
      "I don't see that yet anywhere.\n",
      "Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off.\n",
      "If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times I'd rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe, which is possible, but very sensitive and if you miss, here comes snooze!\n",
      "Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly.\n",
      "I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time.\n",
      "Hoping that works well when it arrives.It will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed.\n",
      "All in all I'd say it's a good emerging technology but needs a little work.\n",
      "Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago It's kind of where we're heading.\n",
      "Alexa Show is really well put together.\n",
      "The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen.\n",
      "Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more.\n",
      "The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones.\n",
      "Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them.\n",
      "The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you.\n",
      "Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music).\n",
      "You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc.\n",
      "The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close.\n",
      "The sound fills the room nicely.\n",
      "When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too.\n",
      "Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you.\n",
      "Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!\n",
      "I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot.\n",
      "Black Friday gave me reason to buy one.\n",
      "I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo.\n",
      "The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals.\n",
      "I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it.\n",
      "I may be getting another :) No real upgrades to the iPhone 7 from the 6.\n",
      "There is no learning curve for sure.\n",
      "However the camera is better and that is a plus.\n",
      "We have greatly enjoyed using Alexa and having this gadget in our kitchen.\n",
      "I love the echo show.\n",
      "It is a personal assistant, DJ, weatherman & news person all in one.\n",
      "This is our second Show.\n",
      "We love the video qualties & the sound can't be beat.\n",
      "My entire family enjoyed all of the purchases we from the store Wife wanted this gift and it did not disappoint, it's the next step in Amazon's capabilities, adding visual to the sound that was already there.\n",
      "I had an Alexa, but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it, see videos for info I wanted to look up, play my prime video account.\n",
      "It would have been a 5 if I could see all prime shows/movies on it.\n",
      "The echo show works great for home automation.\n",
      "Being able to see your security cameras or drop in on your home through the echos camera are great features.\n",
      "Its great, just needs expanding information on it.\n",
      "We had the Echo (still do, it's just in another room) and purchased the Show.\n",
      "We also have a couple of Dots and have them all set to communicate with each other.\n",
      "As you walk by the Show, it gives mini tips, news, fun facts, etc.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "You can even use it like Skype with others who have a show.\n",
      "My wife wanted this, so I got it as a gift.\n",
      "Even though I have had an Amazon Echo for a year, I think the Show is much better.\n",
      "The screen takes a lot of the mystery out of what Alexa is doing.\n",
      "Both my wife and daughter love it.\n",
      "This thing is awesome, great speakers on it too.\n",
      "Go out and grab one Our 5th Echo Show.\n",
      "We love the Drop In feature, allowing us to use them as an intercom.\n",
      "The ease of playing music on all of them at once throughout the house, and controlled from any device is used daily.\n",
      "The connection to our Sonos system is a real plus.\n",
      "Also connected to our Dish TV receiver.\n",
      "I love the Echo Show and its many features, great purchase.\n",
      "I use to communicate with family.\n",
      "I love the drop in feature and it‚Äôs much easier to hear everyone as opposed to FaceTime on speakerphone.\n",
      "It has more to offer, but that is enough for me to recommend for anyone who uses video to keep in touch.\n",
      "Was recommended to me, and we love it, use for music, timer in the kitchen, great recipes, and love the question of the day, only have had for 2 weeks can‚Äôt wait to explore more!\n",
      "Bought for my daughters dorm, good device for streaming, making calls, etc., even for quick weather report Love it so much!\n",
      "Have been using it every day...news, YouTube videos... buying more smart home products to make good use of Alexa.\n",
      "I love this unit.\n",
      "Very well designed and built.\n",
      "It's very easy to use and has a huge amount of features.\n",
      "The screen is beautiful, but the audio could use a bit more bass IMHO.\n",
      "I bought 3 for Christmas gifts.\n",
      "The screen really does add tremendous value.\n",

      "It was priced well and I find it useful.\n",
      "We are new to connected home equipment.\n",
      "I got this for my wife in our kitchen.\n",

      "Then one day, I asked Alexa to play a video and she responded by saying,\"Google is not supported on Echo Show.\"\n",
      "Until YouTube comes back as a skill, the Echo Show probably isn't worth the extra money.\n",
      "I'd say stick with the Echo if you have Amazon Music or Spotify, or the Echo Dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home.\n",
      "Having LOTS of fun with Alexa!\n",

      "Still all in all we're happy with the purchase.\n",
      "It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare.\n",

      "So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones.\n",

      "IE; weather forecast, you get whatever Bing uses and the short version.\n",

      "I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it.\n",
      "It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State.\n",
      "I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home.\n",
      "Absolutely love the Amazon Alexa devices, we now have six in our house and have them connected to Sonos, nest, Arlo and other devices I purchased it so the weather and info can be seen on the screen.\n",
      "At the time I never knew there was an echo spot or I would have tried that.\n",
      "The show sounds good however I wish there was a ring or something on top that would light up like the original alexa.\n",

      "Having a blast listening to any kind of music and asking questions.\n",
      "So we added this to our Echo family of devices.\n",
      "It's nice to have screen, but I honestly don't find I use it as much as I thought I would.\n",
      "The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we've had some technical issues that I haven't been able to resolve as of yet.\n",
      "Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter.\n",
      "It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices.\n",
      "It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about.\n",

      "The first thing I noticed is that the Dot‚Äôs ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the Show.\n",
      "However, I think the Show‚Äôs speaker is better for listening to music.The screen on the Show is handy for looking at recipes, seeing the shopping list or watching the timer.\n",
      "Could you live with just the Dot?\n",
      "Absolutely, but there are some nice features that make the Show a handy gadget to have around.\n",
      "Amazon show is pretty cool, It can help with things like cooking recipe, homework and other things.\n",

      "It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house.\n",

      "The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.\n",
      "We were interested in the Echo line of products after we purchased our Vivint security system.\n",
      "The Echo Show is a perfect addition.\n",
      "We are able to view our security cameras from the The Echo Show and it works great in general as an Echo with all its features.\n",
      "Great to talk and see family at anytime.\n",
      "Easy to use I love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video, security camera footage, Amazon Prime music lyrics and videos, but I am disappointed that Amazon‚Äôs implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated Google's terms of service so they got the app pulled from the Show.\n",
      "Also, honestly, and anyone can prove it just through everyday use, but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries.\n",
      "It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn't understand or can't help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it.\n",
      "I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen.\n",

      "Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5\" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.\n",

      "Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view.\n",
      "First, you start with your home screen.\n",
      "You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet.\n",
      "All of your apps are housed here.\n",
      "You swipe up to view all of them.\n",
      "The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc.\n",
      "You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.\n",
      "You can combine the apps on this page into folders.\n",
      "You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears.\n",
      "This made my home screen much more manageable.\n",
      "You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings.\n",
      "This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however.\n",
      "I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\"\n",
      "The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post.\n",
      "You'll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos.\n",
      "You can do this through the settings menu on the device.\n",
      "If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper.\n",
      "I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app.\n",
      "I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet.\n",
      "That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device.\n",
      "I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen.\n",
      "They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand.\n",
      "All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account.\n",
      "For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu.\n",
      "Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu.\n",
      "There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages.\n",
      "That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world.\n",
      "There's also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu.\n",
      "It's the \"recent\" page.\n",
      "It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet.\n",
      "I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's \"On Deck\" capability.\n",
      "If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like.\n",
      "The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full.\n",
      "You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don't like it.\n",
      "I've been content with the video playback capability.\n",
      "This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK.\n",
      "I'll talk more about the speakers later.\n",
      "My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand.\n",
      "I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous.\n",
      "Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them.\n",
      "One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free.\n",
      "I just had to connect my account to the device.\n",
      "This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account.\n",
      "My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version.\n",
      "(It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.)\n",
      "There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device.\n",
      "I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year.\n",
      "Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed.\n",
      "You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.)\n",
      "You can Google to find the instructions to do this.\n",
      "It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology.\n",
      "It probably took me 10 minutes.\n",
      "Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play.\n",
      "The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store.\n",
      "They have worked fine so far.\n",
      "I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device.\n",
      "There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard.\n",
      "I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it.\n",
      "I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard.\n",
      "It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me.\n",
      "If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy.\n",
      "The screen on this device isn't bad.\n",
      "If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK.\n",
      "There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen.\n",
      "I won't say that they are fantastic.\n",
      "They aren't.\n",
      "In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show.\n",
      "They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile.\n",
      "You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny.\n",
      "That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures.\n",
      "It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular.\n",
      "I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands.\n",
      "I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick.\n",
      "Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome).\n",
      "I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives.\n",
      "I'm still waiting for it.\n",
      "I'm greatly enjoying this device.\n",
      "It's simply fun to use the tablet.\n",
      "There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services.\n",
      "If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.\n",
      "Both love this tablet and the numerous educational apps available that I bought one for each I have several Kindles so knew what to expect.\n",
      "It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.\n",
      "My 5 year old sons love it , Seems to be well made .\n",
      "I bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my 2 youngest Grandaughters.\n",
      "Wanted something that would be made well, easy to use and as they get older the range of use could expand.\n",
      "Not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool.\n",
      "I will download fun and game activities but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tools.\n",
      "Their ages are 3 1/2 and 5 and they love them.\n",
      "Easy to download items, save to home screen or remove items.\n",
      "Their are several parental controls and options so you can feel worry free.\n",
      "Can add more than one user and profile.\n"

      "This Kindle does not have the back light.\n",
      "I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me.\n",
      "When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me.\n",
      "That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem.\n",
      "I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to.\n",

      "Easy enough to use for our 2 year old grandson.\n",
      "Bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life.\n",
      "I love hear readers, I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last, but it is awesome I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well .\n",
      "also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups This is an awesome product.I also own a paperwhite, if you always read in good lighting I would recommend you save some money and buy this instead of the paperwhite.\n",

      "Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes.\n",
      "You wont run out of memory.\n",
      "It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k.\n",
      "Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good.\n",
      "It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games.\n",
      "Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU.\n",
      "It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job.\n",
      "It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\n",

      "For the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network.\n",

      "There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it.\n",
      "The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen.\n",
      "This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.\n",
      "I purchased two of these tablet a pink and blue.\n",
      "They was for my 5 and 7 years children.\n",

      "I really liked the many facets of the Tablet.\n",
      "Presence of Alexa does provide opportunity for Adults to play and surprise by it.The only caveat is Amazon Free Time is for only 1 Year which Amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for Prime Members but thats more of service and no complains on Tablet.\n",
      "It was all that my grandson wanted and didn't have to search everywhere to find it.\n",
      "I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works.\n",

      "I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter.\n",
      "I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad.\n",
      "It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising.\n",
      "Seriously?\n",
      "It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS.\n",
      "Lame.\n",
      "The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes.\n"

      "The speaker quality is great for a portable option.\n",
      "The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.\n",

      "Love that it's battery powered.\n",
      "Never had an issue of it running out of juice.\n",
      "The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot.\n",
      "Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to \"tap\" the speaker to get it to listen.\n",
      "The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better.\n",
      "However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy..\n",
      "It was a good concept just poor execution.\n",
      "We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything.\n",

      "It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo.\n",

      "Full disclosure.\n",
      "I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes.\n",
      "Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot.\n",
      "I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question.\n",
      "However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command.\n",
      "IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor.\n",
      "Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music.\n",

      "It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well.\n",
      "The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music.\n",
      "This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the \"home\" button to use Alexa I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.\n",

      "The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed.\n",
      "EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist!\n",
      "If only...\n",
      "This is my second Echo purchase.\n",
      "My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside.\n",
      "The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient.\n",
      "This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well.\n",
      "Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing.\n",
      "Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability.\n",
      "Good to have both.\n",
      "Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good.\n",
      "Best speaker with Alexa enabled.\n",
      "Value of money!!\n",
      "Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale.\n",
      "I've been pleasantly surprised.\n",
      "Search sounds great for its size.\n",
      "We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen.\n",
      "Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.\n",
      "I love my tap.\n",
      "It sounds great and is so easy to use.\n",
      "Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them!\n",
      "Very useful!\n",
      "I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked Much better than the echo dot.\n",
      "However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying.\n",
      "Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.\n",
      "Great addition to my Alexa collection.\n",
      "Very portable, batter lasts as expected.\n",
      "It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music.\n",
      "So convenient.\n",
      "Love this!\n",
      "I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo.\n",
      "This was actually an impulse buy.\n",
      "I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much.\n",
      "It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great.\n",
      "When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok.\n",
      "The lows are there but doesn't sound good.\n",
      "I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink.\n",
      "When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent.\n",
      "The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume.\n",
      "Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands.\n",
      "I do like the fact that it's portable.\n",
      "Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.\n",
      "I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa.\n",
      "I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music.\n",
      "The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base.\n",
      "Great sound and functionality.\n",
      "Minimal kinks in programming.\n",
      "Love it for my bedroom.\n",
      "The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house.\n",
      "this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right.\n",
      "I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot.\n",
      "The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable.\n",
      "Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products.\n",
      "recommended with caveats It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station This is the best of both worlds.\n",
      "A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device.\n",
      "I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.\n",
      "The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond.\n",
      "Sounds great when playing music Used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how I can use Spotify with it....just say Alexa, and ask for your favorite artist.....\n",
      "I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability.\n",
      "It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll.\n",
      "I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs.\n",
      "It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing.\n",
      "Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard.\n",
      "Probably our own fault.\n",
      "We have fun with it.\n",
      "Thoughts of being able to have the Echo \"grow\" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me.\n",
      "Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls.\n",
      "However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone.\n",
      "Disappointed is a understatement.\n",
      "Was easy to set up.\n",
      "Excellent sound quality for the price I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound.\n",
      "When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase!\n",
      "Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I!\n",
      "If you are a Prime member, this is a must!\n",
      "If you aren't...then you really should be!\n",
      "Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....\n",
      "I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.\n",
      "The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money.\n",
      "Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it.\n",
      "Works as expected.\n",
      "Easy set up and amazing usefulness, love it.\n",
      "I use it all the time and continue to find new ways to take advantage of all there is within Alexa.\n",
      "Will purchase another one for bedroom!\n",
      "Love this product.\n",
      "It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing.\n",
      "Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo.\n",
      "Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself.\n",
      "However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also.\n",
      "One has to take it down just in order to charge.\n",
      "I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it.\n",
      "Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa.\n",
      "Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base.\n",
      "We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.\n",
      "Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable!\n",
      "Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker.\n",
      "Amazon Tap is awesome.\n",
      "Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.\n",
      "This is a great product.\n",
      "I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great.\n",
      "I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights.\n",
      "I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.\n",
      "Got this on sale for 100!\n"

      "I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive.\n",
      "When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me.\n",
      "Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed?\n",
      "Well, not so much.\n",
      "There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day.\n",
      "That one is impossible for me.\n",
      "There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often.\n",
      "My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off.\n",
      "That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember.\n",
      "The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10.\n",
      "That is way too low for me.\n",
      "I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off.\n",
      "My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading.\n",
      "So how long does a single charge last me?\n",
      "Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off.\n",
      "Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low.\n",
      "I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover.\n",
      "I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white.\n",
      "For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color.\n",
      "But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up.\n",
      "They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at.\n",
      "You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked.\n",
      "If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it?\n",
      "Yes, I would have.\n",

      "Sometimes it is a bit slow opening up different apps and functions but overall it is functional, dependable and useful to me I use my Kindle fire HD 10 in 3 ways 1 for reading Kindle books, 2 for streaming TV shows or movies while riding my exercise bike, 3 to surf the internet.\n",
      "Bought this tablet for my 84 year old grandpa and he loves it.\n",

      "I've had a IPad and would rather have the HD10!\n",
      "It's what-1/3 of the price of a IPad and just as good, if not better This was an Xmas gift for my wife.\n",
      "She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative.\n",
      "First the screen size was just what I wanted.\n",
      "Second the price was very reasonable.\n",
      "Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs.\n",
      "She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving.\n",

      "And I made my wife happy .\n",
      "I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same.\n",
      "Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product.\n",
      "We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it.\n",
      "We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad.\n",
      "Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience.\n",
      "If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.\n",

      "It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less.\n",
      "The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover.\n",
      "I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it.\n",

      "But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath.\n",

      "Voyage is still not a bad option though Want a port for addition memory this model had it!\n",
      "This kindle has made life easier by adding the micro sd card slot to enhance the memory capacity up to 128gb more than it has built in, makes it easy to switch cards so you can have your whole library on hand without slowing down the overall processing capability For books games and internet it's perfectSound is a ittle weak I like this so much more than the Voyage.\n",
      "The shape makes for easier holding.\n",
      "I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book Got me reading again!\n",
      "Love the merlot cover.\n",
      "This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked.\n",
      "Also the lightest I believe.\n",
      "Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended.\n",
      "This was an upgrade from my Amazon 7 inch.\n",
      "Bigger screen was the key for me.\n",
      "It's great for listening to music, reading books, watching movies, tv sports, tv shows and playing all the games.\n",

      "All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade.\n",
      "The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model.\n",
      "It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently.\n",
      "This is definitely a good investment!\n",
      "I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it.\n",
      "She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is.\n",
      "Works great for my grandson - had the Geek squad get a security plan setup on it and him acquainted with it.\n",
      "Battery life not great, but with a bright 10 inch screen on a THIN tablet is not surprising.\n",
      "Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager.\n",
      "cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up.\n",
      "finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed.\n",
      "cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.\n",
      "Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out.\n",
      "Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.\n",
      "I really like the auto on off feature.\n",
      "Volume control could be more ergonomic.\n",
      "This Fire 10 is so much better than my old Kindle Fire HD that I now wonder why I waited so long to upgrade.\n",
      "The 10' display is awesome and the speed is very good.\n",
      "All the Amazon apps from my old Kindle were immediately loaded onto my new one and adding the others through the Kindle app store was quick and easy.\n",
      "I wasn't offer the warranty, but I enjoy it a lot.\n",
      "We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games.\n",
      "However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable.\n",
      "The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life.\n",
      "There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.\n",
      "When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite.\n",
      "Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time.\n",
      "I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling).\n",
      "So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage.\n",
      "The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position.\n",
      "This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions.\n",
      "I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed).\n",
      "I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me.\n",
      "I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite).\n",
      "It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there.\n",
      "When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months.\n",
      "The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it.\n",
      "The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle.\n",
      "I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time.\n",
      "It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis.\n",
      "The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.\n",
      "Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand.\n",
      "If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks.\n",
      "Lovin' it so far.\n",
      "Second kindle I use it for reading,games,internet,and shopping Love Amazon however their tablet limits you to using their browser and their apps.\n",

      "They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen.\n",
      "Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does.\n",
      "The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.\n",

      "Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing.\n",
      "It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand.\n",
      "It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths.\n",
      "It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day.\n",
      "so far so good,,,, wife very happy.\n",
      "misses her old one....\n",
      "Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for.\n",
      "Probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the Voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality.\n",
      "I have an old Kindle Touch, the last one that still had text-to-voice, which no longer works.\n",
      "I decided to upgrade, started reading the reviews, was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge.\n",
      "The Voyage is pretty and sleek, with neat features, and I enjoyed using it for a few days, but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite.\n",
      "While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room.\n",
      "I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the \"page turn\" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn.\n",
      "However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice.\n",
      "Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite.\n",
      "The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it.\n",
      "The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage.\n",
      "I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy.\n",
      "However, it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious.\n",
      "If money is not an object, I'd say get the Kindle Voyage, if it is, the Paperwhite is a fine little reader, and overall I'm happy I have it.\n",
      "this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...\n",
      "I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out.\n",
      "This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit.\n",
      "It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light.\n",
      "Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here.\n",
      "I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time.\n",
      "The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight.\n",
      "By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets.\n",
      "The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store.\n",
      "I don't think it's an issue with my network since all our other devices don't have the connectivity issues we had with this.\n",
      "Have had it for a while noe.\n",
      "A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.\n",
      "I am extremely happy with my new Kindle Voyage.\n",
      "The text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the Kindle Paperwhite.\n",
      "The device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, The adaptive front light works great.\n",
      "I have an iPad with the Kindle app, but the reading experience is so much better on my Kindle Voyage that don't regret the purchase one bit.\n",
      "The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly.\n",
      "Even though it is a little pricy, I like my new Kindle Voyage.\n",
      "It looks smaller, but it is because it's only the screen - no buttons.\n",
      "It is lightweight.\n",
      "You can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side.\n",
      "It is automatically adjusts to different light conditions.\n",
      "The original electronic book.\n",
      "Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week.\n",

      "Voyage is still not a bad option though I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best.\n",
      "The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed.\n",
      "Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type.\n",
      "They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen.\n",
      "Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does.\n"

      "Great device for home or on the go.\n",
      "Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27.\n",
      "Well done Best Buy!\n",
      "Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely.\n",
      "The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case.\n",
      "The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces.\n",
      "Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\" wide by 5.5\" tall.\n",
      "In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are).\n",
      "It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse.\n",
      "The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle.\n",
      "No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions.\n",
      "The \"page\" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper.\n",
      "It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used.\n",
      "The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets.\n",
      "After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is.\n",
      "It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching.\n",
      "The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also \"follow\", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward.\n",
      "You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models.\n",
      "The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case.\n",
      "It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read.\n",
      "The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite.\n",
      "I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge.\n",
      "The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off.\n",
      "You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now.\n",
      "It's a minor annoyance.\n",
      "Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite).\n",
      "Is this a lot of money?\n",
      "Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it.\n",
      "A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that.\n",
      "Is it for everyone?\n",
      "Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website.\n",
      "If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!\n",
      "Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life.\n",
      "I bought the Kindle Oasis for my wife as a 37th-anniversary gift.\n",
      "She enjoys reading and I thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice.\n",
      "She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it.\n",
      "She writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the Kindle did its notes.\n",
      "For just reading I think it would be a very nice product.\n",
      "Was a gift to replace older one and she really likes this one.\n",
      "Light and the battery last much longer.\n",
      "Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear.\n",
      "That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky.\n",
      "I really do read for hours at a time.\n",
      "Sometimes I pace the floor while I read.\n",
      "Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read.\n",
      "And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down.\n",
      "No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words.\n",
      "If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger.\n",
      "I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive.\n",
      "When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me.\n",
      "Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed?\n",
      "Well, not so much.\n",
      "There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day.\n",
      "That one is impossible for me.\n",
      "There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often.\n",
      "My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off.\n",
      "That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember.\n",
      "The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10.\n",
      "That is way too low for me.\n",
      "I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off.\n",
      "My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading.\n",
      "So how long does a single charge last me?\n",
      "Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off.\n",
      "Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low.\n",
      "I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover.\n",
      "I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white.\n"

      "They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at.\n",

      "I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16\" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode.\n",
      "I also have a high end \"phablet\" sized phone.\n",
      "So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad.\n",
      "The Fire has been a great \"in between\" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop.\n",
      "The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough.\n",
      "Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb).\n",
      "Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime).\n",
      "Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great.\n",

      "I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these.\n",
      "At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system.\n",
      "I don't feel like I'm using Android.\n",
      "This feels different to me.\n",
      "It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate.\n",
      "That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine.\n",
      "It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device.\n",
      "The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen.\n",
      "The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button.\n",
      "It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open.\n",
      "The button to the right is super important.\n",
      "It took me a couple of days to realize what it does.\n",
      "That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open.\n",
      "It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out.\n",
      "You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right.\n",
      "If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery.\n",
      "Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view.\n",
      "First, you start with your home screen.\n",
      "You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet.\n",
      "All of your apps are housed here.\n",
      "You swipe up to view all of them.\n",
      "The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc.\n",
      "You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.\n",
      "You can combine the apps on this page into folders.\n",
      "You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears.\n",
      "This made my home screen much more manageable.\n",
      "You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings.\n",
      "This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however.\n",
      "I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\"\n",
      "The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post.\n",
      "You'll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos.\n",
      "You can do this through the settings menu on the device.\n",
      "If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper.\n",
      "I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app.\n",
      "I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet.\n",
      "That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device.\n",
      "I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen.\n",
      "They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand.\n",
      "All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account.\n",
      "For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu.\n",
      "Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu.\n",
      "There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages.\n",
      "That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world.\n",
      "There's also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu.\n",
      "It's the \"recent\" page.\n",
      "It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet.\n",
      "I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's \"On Deck\" capability.\n",
      "If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like.\n",
      "The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full.\n",
      "You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don't like it.\n",
      "I've been content with the video playback capability.\n",
      "This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK.\n",
      "I'll talk more about the speakers later.\n",
      "My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand.\n",
      "I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous.\n",
      "Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them.\n",
      "One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free.\n",
      "I just had to connect my account to the device.\n",
      "This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account.\n",
      "My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version.\n",
      "(It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.)\n",
      "There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device.\n",
      "I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year.\n",
      "Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed.\n",
      "You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.)\n",
      "You can Google to find the instructions to do this.\n",
      "It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology.\n",
      "It probably took me 10 minutes.\n",
      "Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play.\n",
      "The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store.\n",
      "They have worked fine so far.\n",
      "I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device.\n",
      "There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard.\n",
      "I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it.\n",
      "I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard.\n",
      "It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me.\n"

      "It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.\n",

       "5049   Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5\" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great We love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.   \n",
